            This chart shows which features contributed most to **this patientâ€™s predicted risk**.

            **How to read the plot:**
            - The **top two bars** summarize the total influence:
                - **Risk Increasing Evidence** (red): Sum of all features that pushed the risk higher.
                - **Risk Decreasing Evidence** (blue): Sum of all features that pulled the risk lower.
            - The **individual bars below** show each feature's specific impact.
                - Longer bars indicate stronger influence.
                - Red bars *increased* the predicted risk.
                - Blue bars *decreased* the predicted risk.

            - See what pushed the patient's risk up or down.
            - Identify the most influential clinical factors.
